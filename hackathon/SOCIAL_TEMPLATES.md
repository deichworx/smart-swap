### r/solana Post
```
**Title:** Built a one-tap swap app for Solana Mobile Seeker [Hackathon]

**Body:**

I've been building Smart Swap for the Solana Mobile Hackathon - a mobile app that reduces token swaps to a single tap.

**The problem:** DeFi on mobile is clunky. Too many steps, too many confirmations.

**The solution:** Smart Swap remembers your preferences and executes swaps with one tap. Jupiter handles the routing.

**Features:**
- One-tap swap execution
- Jupiter-powered best rates
- Full swap history
- Loyalty rewards (hold SKR = lower fees)

**Tech stack:**
- Expo/React Native
- Solana Mobile Wallet Adapter
- Jupiter Swap API v1
- AsyncStorage for persistence

Demo video: [link]
GitHub: [link]

Feedback welcome! Especially from Seeker owners.
```

### r/SolanaMobile Post
```
**Title:** Smart Swap - One-tap swaps built for Seeker

**Body:**

Fellow Seeker owners! Built something specifically for us.

Smart Swap reduces the swap process to literally one tap. No more:
- Wallet popups
- Token search
- Amount entry every time

Just tap, confirm, done.

Using Jupiter for routing so you always get good rates.

Looking for beta testers when Seeker ships! DM if interested.
